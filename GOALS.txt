  - maybe a timer?
  - stats (who did the most damage)

- Stage object
  - include spawn locations for players
  - and spawn locations for powerups

- add a 'flash' command

- think about longer term goals?
  - other game modes (climbing)
  - character creation screen
  - powerups (extra platform, more hp, faster recharge, ...)
  - main menu
